# BestCityGuide
Best City Guide is a website you co-create with TreeHouse. I'm just attempting to make it WordPress ready.

ORIGIN
Best City Guide is a site already made by TreeHouse when you are learning CSS. Somebody by the name of Sonja Toncic has made a improved version of Best City Guide with HTML and CSS. Take a look at it here:

MY WORK
I'm attempting to bring a Best City Guide Theme to WordPress. I'll be updating this from time to time. I started this project on 5 Nov 2018.
