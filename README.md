ORIGIN
Best City Guide is a site already made by TreeHouse when you are learning CSS. Somebody by the name of Sonja Toncic has made a improved version of Best City Guide with HTML and CSS. Take a look at it here:

MY WORK
I'm attempting to bring a Best City Guide Theme to WordPress. I'll be updating this from time to time. I started this project on 5 Nov 2018.


HISTORY
2018 Nov 5 - Did the basics, plus the loop. Don't have navigation down at this time.
2018 Nov 15 - Added page.php nad got the navigation down. Had troubles with sidebar.php (didn't upload that), I need to do some troubleshooting.
